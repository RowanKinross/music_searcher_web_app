# Earworm Extractors

## Project status
Development for this project is on pause, for now.



## Description

An online, interactive, five-step programme to remove songs stuck in your head. This was a group project aimed to explore web-application possibilities with the introduction of (free) APIs. The motivation behind this project was to distill the recommended processes for removing "ear-worms" into a simple app that is accessible and more compacted than seeking out the steps individually. The app, if followed as intended, should successfully remove a song stuck in a users head and allow a user to focus on the issue in a minumally distractable format. Whilst the project is light-hearted, it does follow the stages set out by psychology today, and should function as a legitimately helpful resource. As a team, still in the early stages of our learning in web development, we learned a lot about how to plan, research, divide roles, work together and share code in a web-development context. We also furthered our knowledge, understanding and confidence in css styling, APIs and javascript.

## Installation
n/a


## Usage
The page is styled with a retro look. The title and the header bar show the name of the application - "earworm extractor". On the initial display, a user is met with a search bar which takes an input-search term such as a song lyric, title, or artist linked to the song that is stuck in the user's head. Upon submit, the user is given a second display with step 2 of the removal - a recommendation to listen to the song from start to finish. The user is also presented with the APIs response to their search term in the format "song-name by artist". This is followed by a button which can be clicked to move onto the next display. Next a url to the lyrics for that song is displayed and the user is encouraged to read the lyrics, in full, in a seperate tab. After that a sudoku board appears, with empty input boxes allowing the user to solve it. There is a reveal solution button which can be clicked upon completion to check answers (or if the user gives up). Finally the user is met with a recommendations page, featuring a list of some of the teams song recommendations, plus a return to start button. Upon pressing the return to start button, the user can begin the process again.


## Contributing
As we set this as a mini-project for our team, we are not currently looking for contributors.
