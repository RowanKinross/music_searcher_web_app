Order of process:
1. User searches for lyrics/artist/title
2. They're given the lyrics to read 
3. They can then bin the lyrics or set the lyrics on fire, alternatively they'll be bombed at the end of the timer
4. Confirm are you over 18? (21 in the US)
    if yes: Once the lyrics are gone, they get a random recipe for a cocktail
    if no: once the lyrics are gone, they get a random gif
